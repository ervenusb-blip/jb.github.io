# AI Video Generator Sample

## Overview
This is a simple sample project to demonstrate how to create an AI video generator interface with:

- A Node.js backend that accepts a prompt and returns a sample video URL
- A frontend HTML page where you can input a prompt and get a video playback

## Quick Start

### Backend Setup
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Backend` folder.
3. Run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend Setup
1. Open the `Frontend/index.html` file in any modern browser.
2. Type a video prompt in the text area.
3. Click **Generate Video**.
4. A sample video will play below.

### Notes
- This is a sample setup. You can replace the backend logic to integrate actual AI video generation APIs.
- The sample video URL used is a public test video.
